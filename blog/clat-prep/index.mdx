## Quantitative Aptitude aka Maths

As we know, this section consists simply 15 marks, but these 15 marks decide whether you are getting a seat in the top 5 NLU or not because my friend's lot of people don't like do give serious attention to this part though I recommend you don't make the same mistake that other does 
So try to do this book mentally

## Conclusion 

Some essential tips for law entrance exam 

1. Three types of students were going to prepare for the class exam   
*i.* those how are at the 11th class I suggest you guys if you are at 11th class, so you have two years to prepare yourself for the class exam don't waste this time in first-year try to complete the whole syllabus around clat and other law entrance exam and in next year only do question practice,  perform test series. Mocks and analysis also. This make your game easy.  
*ii.* now lets talk about how are the 12th class guys as i say you need to learn thing smarty not hard working like first of fall try to study 5 to 6hrs in a day for clat exam and know lot of students say this is not possible know let me tell you a truth, your main goal is to crack clat exam not a geting 90%+ in board exam so you have to choose wisely with thing is more important for me and also do theory and praticeing the question simultaneously. If you give 2 hrs for board exam on daily bases thats enough for you to get around  70% so total hrs you need to study is 7-8 hrs a day and thats not a big deal because at the end its pay back   
*iii.* those how take drop this year for preparing clat and other law entrecne exam you guys nothing do wrong but also mind that to take admission in any open college like DU SOL etc for safer side in this 1 year drop period you guys have nothing to do else prepraing for clat and i suggest you to be focused i once you chose law as a career than dont pay attention what other say you just show them a end result prepare as much hard as you can so you have 24 hrs a day try to study at least 7-8 hrs at day this is not a big deal you can do it easily the big deal is consistency lot of student fail at cus of focus .

2. Three things that give you a boost on your consistency 
 on a daily basis, try to make a sheet where you write what you are going to perform; it's like a (TODO or TIME-TABLE)
At the beginning of your day, try to do 2-3 min meditation, not more than 5 min; it keeps you focused and calm. 
And while studying, try to perform Pomodoro while doing this thing you were not exhausted  if you don't know what Pomodoro technique it is like you only study 25 min and take 5 min break something like that for more search on google.

3. I go straight to point at here if you have a money problem and are not able to enroll yourself in a couching center, then nothing is wrong in today digital era you get paid stuff for free I'm not promoting any piracy, but that is true you have two main sources to prepare for the class exam that was youtube and telegram in YT channels like grade up the legal edge, and a telegram, at here you get paid book and mocks test for free but on telegram don't waste your time unnecessary debates ad talks and you have no need to make new friends on telegram go on telegram for only getting your important study material and start preparing them. 

4. At last, giving mock is important but more important is to analyze them so don't miss analyzing part became very serious about analyzing your mistake and no matter how much time or years you have just started giving mocks in time boundaries from tomorrow and try at least to give one mock in a weak and after that analysis, they from where you get mock I think you know the place. 

And everything is possible if you are serious about them, and being a consist is critical to crack any exam. At last, this is not so much a challenging exam; it's the regular exam to break them, and finally, after giving this exam, I learned that you have to read more or as much as you can; reading a passage is a vital part here.
